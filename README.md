In this paper, an attempt is made to approach the modern Applications of
Photogrammetry, in conjunction with the Science of Artificial Intelligence. The
automated methods now offered by the Computer Vision and Machine Learning
fields, are changing dramatically the way things worked by now on Photogrammetry
Applications.
Therefore, the aim was to become acquainted with the aforementioned Sciences
and their applications and also to create a code capable of detecting coded targets on
images, with the purpose to use them in Photogrammetric Applications. The detection
of those targets can simplify some tasks that, under normal circumstances, are timeconsuming
and expensive procedures in Photogrammetry applications. Also, they
may have required a user to supervise the proccedures and perhaps do some manual
works too.
The result of this paper is a successful operation of the semi-automatic target
recognition code on images, a fact that gives rise to the expectation of the integration
of the code in more complex applications and also, of its further development.
I hope that, through this experiment, the knowledge that I personally had the
chance to obtain, might be transferred to the readers and that it may contribute, even
to the minimum, to the evolution of the technology offered in the field of
Photogrammetry and therefore, of the Scientific field of Topography.
