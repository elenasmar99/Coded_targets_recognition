This repository contains the code developed as part of my thesis “Semi-automatic Recognition of Coded Targets in Photogrammetry Applications”.
The workflow follows these steps:

Image collection – Capturing images, some of them containing coded photogrammetric targets.

Data preprocessing – Organizing the images for further use.

Target annotation – Manually labeling the coded targets to create a training dataset.

Code development – Implementing a MATLAB algorithm for semi-automatic target detection and recognition.

Training & recognition – Applying machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze images and recognize the targets.

Results – The code achieves ~90% success in target recognition, reducing manual effort and significantly speeding up photogrammetry workflows.
